## DMTL

**R package for Distribution Mapping based Transfer Learning**

To install it on your local machine, you will need the `devtools` package which is [available](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/index.html) in CRAN. You can install it using the following command -  
		\code{install.packages("devtools")}

Once you have it, you need to use the following code chunk -  
		library(devtools)  
		install_github("dhruba018/DMTL")
