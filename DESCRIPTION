Description: Implementation of a transfer learning framework employing distribution matching based domain transfer. One can use the underlying sample distributions (histogram or density estimates) to generate a map between two distinct but related domains and transfer the target data to the source domain and utilize the available source data for better predictive modeling design. Suitable for the case where a one-to-one sample matching is not possible, thus one needs to transform the underlying data distribution to utilize the more availble data for modeling.
